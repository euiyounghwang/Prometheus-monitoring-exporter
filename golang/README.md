## Golang Setup

GoNB offers a pre-built docker, that includes JupyterLab and GoNB. To use it, go to a directory that you want to make available to the Jupyter notebook (your home directory, or a directory where to store the notebook files). It will be mounted on the host/ subdirectory in JupyterLab.

## Golang
If youâ€™re starting a new project, create a new module by running the following command: (https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/go/)
- go mod init <mymodulename>
- go tidy

Prometheus has an official Go client library that you can use to instrument Go applications. In this guide, we'll create a simple Go application that exposes Prometheus metrics via HTTP.
- Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/)
- You can install the prometheus, promauto, and promhttp libraries necessary for the guide using go get:
```bash
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promauto
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp
```
- go run main.go
- go build
- http://localhost:2112/metrics (curl http://localhost:2112/metrics)
- compile a go file/project on windows for Linux: `env GOOS=linux go build -o ./bin/prometheus` (Run this command `chmod 755 filname` after copying to linux server)
